# Phase 9 — Clinical validation workflows + PHI handling hardening

## Objective
Run clinical validation workflows and harden PHI handling across kernel, agents, apps, and models.

## Key build activities
- Define validation protocol and acceptance metrics.
- Implement de-identification/redaction improvements.
- Add access controls for evidence bundles.
- Conduct tabletop exercises for failure modes.

## Risks
- Validation scope mismatch (too narrow).
- PHI exposure through logs/evidence.
- Safety events not handled consistently.

## Oversight checks applied
- Clinical governance review of validation plan.
- Privacy + security audits.
- Incident response drills.

## Judge decisions (J1/J2/J3)
- **J1:** Validation methodology sound.
- **J2:** PHI handling meets institutional requirements.
- **J3:** Post-incident evidence and remediation auditable.

## Exit criteria
- Validation results documented.
- PHI hardening measures completed.
- Approval to proceed to production readiness.
